# Setup rSysLogD
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Safe to re-run on live nodes...this script takes care of setting up rsyslogd
# on nodes. The main purpose is to modify what gets sent to /dev/console and
# *.emerg messages.
#
# A bug was also found in that, if users submit /bin/logger notices with emerg
# it would be broadcasted to all users on system. Big no no..
